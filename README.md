We have adopted a modular and organized folder structure that promotes maintainability and scalability. You'll find clear separation of components, styles, utilities, and more.

### Hooks and Refs

We make extensive use of React hooks and refs to manage component state, side effects, and interactions. You'll learn how to harness the full power of React's functional components.

### State Management with React Context API

We demonstrate advanced state management techniques using the React Context API. You'll see how to efficiently manage application-wide state and provide it to components as needed.
